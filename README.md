# Chinese-Remainder-Theorem
A theorem developed by Sun Tzu to solve a system of congruences

Origins:
Date: Around the 3rd century AD

Mathematician: Sun Zi (also spelled Sun Tzu, but not the military strategist)

Text: Sunzi Suanjing (The Mathematical Classic of Sun Zi)

Problem posed: Find a number that leaves remainders 2, 3, and 2 when divided by 3, 5, and 7 respectively. This is an early example of a system of congruences.

Development:
7th century: Chinese mathematician Qin Jiushao later used similar techniques in his work Shùshū Jiǔzhāng ("Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections").

11th century (India): Related ideas appeared in Indian mathematics through Aryabhata and Brahmagupta, although formulated differently.

17th century (Europe): The CRT was formally introduced to the West by Leonhard Euler and later generalized by Carl Friedrich Gauss in his 1801 work Disquisitiones Arithmeticae.

Summary:
The CRT started as a practical problem in ancient Chinese arithmetic and was gradually formalized and generalized in modern number theory. It is now a fundamental result used in computer science, cryptography, and algebra.
